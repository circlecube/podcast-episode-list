# Podcast Episode List
A little vuejs app to pull a podcast feed and list episodes in a table. I built this because I was curious how much of a podcast I has listened to after spending months listening. This is a simple way to mark the listened episodes and get a total.

~~Load in xml feed of all episodes into a list/table.~~
~~Total all episode lengths.~~
~~Checkbox to indicate if it's been listened to.~~
~~Total all checked episodes.~~
~~Save list of checked in localstorage? so it's persistent.~~
~~fixed header and footer.~~
~~update moment to display total hours and not cut into days.~~
~~update to take a feed url in~~
scope localstorage to feed url
save feed url to localstorage
look into firebase for saving data
add toggle to view descirptions
add click sorting by column headers
add a queue - to listen to list
add button to click and listen to episode
?
